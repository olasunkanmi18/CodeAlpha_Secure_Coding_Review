Using Bandit to Analyze the Code >>>
after instaling bandit 
>>>  Run Bandit  with this :
     bandit -r code.py
    it will bring out the output of the code  and issue if there is.

     >>>>>>>>>> Review and Recommendations on code.py Based on Bandit <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    
1. Subprocess with `shell=True`:
    Issue: Using `shell=True` in `subprocess.run` can be dangerous because it allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities.
   - Recommendation: Avoid `shell=True` and pass the command as a list to prevent shell injection.
   - Updated Code:
     ```python
     def execute_command(cmd):
         result = subprocess.run(cmd.split(), capture_output=True, text=True)
         return result.stdout
     ```

2. Hardcoded Password:
   - Issues: Storing sensitive information like passwords directly in the code is insecure and can lead to exposure.
   - Recommendation: Use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms to handle sensitive data.
   - Updated Code:
     ```python
     def connect_to_db():
         db_password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
         if not db_password:
             raise ValueError("No database password set!")
         connection_string = f'mysql://root:{db_password}@localhost/dbname'
         os.system(f'mysql -e "USE dbname;"')
